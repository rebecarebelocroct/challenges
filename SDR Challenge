# Challenge

As a SDR it’s always necessary to understand fully your persona and be able to create good messages to get their attention and book a meeting. Below there are 5 examples of companies you will need to search to complete this challenge:

Contabilizei
VWO
CVC
Cia Hering
Convert

According to the 5 companies listed above, tell us which you would reach out and why.  Also, let us know what your top 3 would be?

You are going to do your first contact via linkedin, what would be the message you would send? Do 1 example for a Marketing Coordinator from Creditas and another one for a Head of Growth from Sem Parar.

Let’s say you joined the outbound team and you see that the only channel for prospecting they are using is email, which other channels and strategies you would use to book meeting?
